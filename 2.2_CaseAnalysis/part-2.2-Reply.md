Dear John Doe,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns regarding the chargeback case related to your recent transaction.

After carefully reviewing the defense documents you provided, we forwarded them to the card issuer for evaluation. Unfortunately, the issuer did not accept our defense, as the cardholder continues to assert that the product or service was not delivered. According to their assessment, the evidence submitted was insufficient to overturn this claim.

We fully understand that this outcome is disappointing, especially since you maintain that the product was indeed delivered. At this point, we recommend the following steps:

Gather any additional proof of delivery, such as signed receipts, delivery confirmation, or relevant correspondence with the customer.

Submit this additional documentation to your account manager or directly through our dispute resolution channel for further review.

If you believe the chargeback is unjustified, you may also consider escalating the case with the card issuer through the appropriate dispute procedures.

Please be assured that we are committed to supporting you throughout this process and will assist in any efforts to resolve this matter fairly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
Luisa Sanches
